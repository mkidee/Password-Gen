# Password-Gen

## Description

I wanted to create a password application in js inorder to practice skills in js. I wanted to hone my skills and be able to have a single page application that runs correctly. This helped me cement my js base skills and practice creating an application that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was good practice to be able connect and intertwine all three of these code languages.

## Installation

To install this application, you can download a zip file if you'd like. Or you could copy (through ssh or html) and clone it through git in your terminal. 

## Usage

To use this password application, simply press the 'generate password' button and follow the prompts on your screen. In no time you will have a completely random password curated to your preferences!
